# ToDos:
- [x] Move installation from README to another file
- [x] Example
- [x] Rename Directories and files appropriately
- [ ] linting of python files
- [ ] Ensure that a minimal set of essential frame files are present
    - these are especially F-Up at the moment.
    - [ ] Reconstruct transform sequence in code... and hide all essential transforms for the frame
    - [ ] Target_Y->Target_Z->Collar->Target_X->Arc
- [ ] Testing the Extension under load
- [ ] Find a fancy frame, if I can
- [ ] Use low-res example files. less than 5 Mb each... if possible...
    - [ ] Reference pig atlas publication
    - [ ] Reduce size of pig-scan
	
## Non-Essential:
- [ ] Reformat along canula
    - IGT - Volume Reslice Driver--- Toggle this option.
    - This is going to take a while....
    - This would combine efforts from the RT module and the incarnations of FlywheelConnect.
